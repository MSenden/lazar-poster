Within the eNanoMapper project in silico toxicology (IST) maintains the RDF
database with nanoparticle ontologies and data.  In order to simplify the
combined search for data and ontologies in the eNanoMapper RDF backend, we have
developed an interface for the visualisation of SPARQL queries. This poster
will present the enm-ontoviewer application together with a usage example and
links to source code, documentation and docker images.
