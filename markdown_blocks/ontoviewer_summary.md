Within the eNanoMapper project in silico toxicology (IST) maintains the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
database with nanoparticle ontologies and data. In order to simplify the
combined search for data and ontologies in the eNanoMapper RDF backend, we have
developed an interface for the visualisation of SPARQL queries. This poster
presents the enm-ontoviewer application \cite{gebele_denis_2017_259384} considering two use case scenarios and
links to source code and documentation.
