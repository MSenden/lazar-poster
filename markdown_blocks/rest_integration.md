lazar-rest provides a REST webservice for the nano-lazar framework. 
The lazar framework integrates internal libraries, eNanoMapper
resources (Data Warehouse and Ontologies) and external resources like UniProt and
BioPortal. lazar-rest services make the lazar framework accessible
for other webservices and web applications and for users who prefer the
command line over graphical user interfaces.
