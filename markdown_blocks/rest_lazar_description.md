*lazar* (lazy structure–activity relationships) is a modular framework for read across predictions of chemical toxicities. 
Within the European Union’s FP7 eNanoMapper project lazar was extended with capabilities to handle nanomaterial data, 
interfaces to other eNanoMapper services (databases and ontologies) and a stable and user-friendly graphical interface 
for nanoparticle read-across predictions. lazar provides a ruby gem library to this developments.
