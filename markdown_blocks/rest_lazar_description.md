`lazar` (lazy structure–activity relationships)\cite{Maunz2013} is a modular framework for read across predictions of chemical toxicities. 
Within the European Union’s FP7 eNanoMapper project `lazar` was extended with capabilities to handle nanomaterial data and interfaces 
to other eNanoMapper services (databases and ontologies). `lazar` libraries are publicly distributed as Ruby gems.
