During the eNanoMapper project in silico toxicologies (IST) public services
were adapted to the specification of the eNanoMapper API and new nanoparticle
specific developments were implemented.  This poster will depict the
interaction of IST services with eNanoMapper resources of other partners which
covers use cases like data download/mirroring, augmentation of GUIs with
ontology queries and nanoparticle descriptor calculation.
