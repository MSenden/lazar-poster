lazar-rest supports QMRF reporting. The integrated QSAR-report library 
generates QMRF reports in XML format with basic model information (e.g.
validation results according to OECD guidelines). The QMRF report
library is independent of other IST libraries (e.g. lazar,
nano-lazar-gui, lazar-rest) and can be used by other applications that
need QMRF reporting.
