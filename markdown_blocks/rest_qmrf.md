`lazar-rest` supports (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF). The integrated QSAR-report library\cite{rautenberg_micha_2016_179038} 
generates QMRF reports in XML format with basic model information (e.g. validation results according 
to OECD guidelines). The QMRF report library is independent of other IST libraries (e.g. `lazar`,
`nano-lazar`-gui, `lazar-rest`) and can be used by other applications that need QMRF reporting.
