lazar-rest do provide QMRF reporting. The integrated QSAR-report Ruby gem library can generate initial QMRF reports in XML format with the basic 
information of a model.
The QSAR-report gem was developed to extend the lazar and nano-lazar toxicity prediction application with QMRF and QPRF reporting features. 
The library gem is independent from lazar or nano-lazar and can also be used in any other ruby code.
