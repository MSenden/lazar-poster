ABSTRACT = {Analyzing chemical datasets is a challenging task for scientific researchers in the field of chemoinformatics. It is important, yet difficult to understand the relationship between the structure of chemical compounds, their physico-chemical properties, and biological or toxic effects. To that respect, visualization tools can help to better comprehend the underlying correlations. Our recently developed 3D molecular viewer CheS-Mapper (Chemical Space Mapper) divides large datasets into clusters of similar compounds and consequently arranges them in 3D space, such that their spatial proximity reflects their similarity. The user can indirectly determine similarity, by selecting which features to employ in the process. The tool can use and calculate different kind of features, like structural fragments as well as quantitative chemical descriptors. These features can be highlighted within CheS-Mapper, which aids the chemist to better understand patterns and regularities and relate the observations to established scientific knowledge. As a final function, the tool can also be used to select and export specific subsets of a given dataset for further analysis.},

abstract  ="Cellular association of nanoparticles (NPs) in biological fluids is affected by proteins adsorbed onto the NP surface{,} forming a {"}protein corona{"}{,} thereby impacting cellular bioactivity. Here we investigate{,} based on an extensive gold NPs protein corona dataset{,} the relationships between NP-cell association and protein corona fingerprints (PCFs) as well as NP physicochemical properties. Accordingly{,} quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were developed based on both linear and non-linear support vector regression (SVR) models making use of a sequential forward floating selection of descriptors. The SVR model with only 6 serum proteins and zeta potential had higher accuracy (R2 = 0.895) relative to the linear model (R2 = 0.850) with 11 PCFs. Considering the initial pool of 148 descriptors{,} the APOB{,} A1AT{,} ANT3{,} and PLMN serum proteins along with NP zeta potential were identified as most significant to correlating NP-cell association. The present study suggests that QSARs exploration of NP-cell association data{,} considering the role of both NP protein corona and physicochemical properties{,} can support the planning and interpretation of toxicity studies and guide the design of NPs for biomedical applications."}
